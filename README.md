# About Me :wave:
Hello, I'm Nikola. I have been training and studying to become a QA since the beginning of 2023. I'm glad I've at last discovered a field where I can grow and succeed. I want to share my QA knowledge and highlight my practical abilities from my work, classes, and independent research in this portfolio. I'm committed to developing further in this area. 


### My experience :office:
Throughout my course at Yandex Praktikum, I gained an in-depth understanding of the QA process, including both manual and automated testing techniques. My training encompassed the following key areas:

* Testing Fundamentals: Learned the principles of software testing, including  test planning, and documentation.

* Test Case Design: Developed skills in creating detailed, efficient test cases and check lists that cover functional and non-functional requirements.

* Bug Reporting: Ability to identify, document, and communicate defects effectively, utilizing tools such as YouTrack and Qase.

* Automation Testing: Explored automation tools like PyCharm and Postman, enabling me to improve testing accuracy.
